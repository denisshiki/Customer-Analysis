# üõíüßç CLIENT BEHAVIOR STUDY - CLUSTERS 
___
## üîç PROBLEM AND PRODUCT

In this projetct I used the Kaggle dataset locate in this link:<br> https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis

In this project I intend to segment the grouping of customers using the K-Means algorithm and then I will analyze the groups. This will help the marketing department better understand their customers and classify them to plan personalized marketing campaigns for each group.<br>
Another purpose is to send a link to the marketing team with the grouped data.

The final product will be something similar to this:
